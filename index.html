        <br>Benjamin Merkli <i>(s3896757)</i><br><hr class="small-line">
                    I was born here in Melbourne, Australia and grew up in the south-east suburb, Mulgrave, which is located between Springvale and Glen Waverley. I am half Lebanese and half Hungarian; however, I can only speak English fluently based on my upbringing. I attended Brentwood Secondary College and obtained my VCE certificate (2015-2020). I have played Australian Football my entire life, as it is something I really enjoy an\\d quite decent at. One fun fact about me is that I have been invited to a player development course/session with the Oakleigh Chargers and Hawthorn Football club to improve on my skills and football knowledge, therefore this can become a gateway to the AFL.  I am very fond of cybersecurity and its ability to protect systems from harmful risks. Moreover, I am very interested in the software and hardware that is in a computer and how certain bits and pieces of wires and plastic can create one of the world's most innovative creations. I was elected as an ICT captain for the school, which heavily involved being surrounded by computers, interactive whiteboards, and other IT related items. My role was to solve computer related issues students and teachers would endure and solve these issues with the school’s IT department.

                      I was born and raised in Bendigo which is a country town 2 hours drive from melbourne. My hobbies are mostly just playing video games and going out with mates to pubs and parties and such.My interest in IT has mostly been a lifelong thing, my dad works in telecommunications so I was always surrendered by computers, tech, and especially phones, I also realised and expanded this interest in school when I took a number of IT related electives.I have been programming for about 6 years now and I have a fair bit of practical experience with networks and working with phones and the internet because of my dad’s job.

        My name is Joshua Lam, and I was born and raised in Australia. My ethnicity is half vietnamese and half timorese. I have completed VCE Year 12 and graduated with a 72.3 ATAR, which has led me to currently study a Bachelors of IT at RMIT. My main spoken language is English. I have loved to play video games ever since I was young, and have also recently gained an interest in cars as well. I’ve recently purchased a vehicle, a Toyota 86, and have added various mods/self-serviced it. My interest in IT involves enjoying taking the time to accurately locate and fix problems, and developed since I was a young age as I grew up with computers. My IT experience revolves mostly around self-learnt abilities such as CMD prompt, Device Manager, and being able to make HTML websites. I have also built many computers, including my own and friends.

	My name is Daniel Rhodes Hindmarsh, student number S3906625. Over here is the photo on my student ID. Although I was born near Devon Meadows Australia, my parents immigrated over from Essex, England in 1995. Overall, I’d call myself Australian with a small patriotic streak for England, it’s superior sweets and chip butties. My interest in IT stems from my want to understand how the things around me work. Computers and software are extremely complicated and I only understand the basics of how they work, as such I find them exceedingly interesting.

            Andy Lu <i>(s3902328)</i><hr class="small-line">
                My parents both come from Vietnam and they both speak Vietnamese and Cantonese, as do I however I am not very fluent in any of those languages. I have just recently graduated high school and I am currently studying my first year of Bachelor of IT at RMIT University. During my spare time, I enjoy playing games with my friends. Ever since I was young I had always had an interest in IT. It was something that I grew up around. My cousins were the ones who inspired and introduced me to computers and IT in general. Where I used to watch my cousins play games on their computers and watch them build and work on their websites. 2017 was the year where my knowledge of IT and computers grew most and was also the year that I decided that I wanted to pursue a career in IT. Although my cousins were the ones who inspired and introduced me to IT they weren’t the ones who sparked my interest in IT, it was UNI, the first few weeks of my course was where I found myself genuinely drawn and interested, whether it was learning Python for the first time or improving my HTML skills all of these events led me to enjoy IT even more. So if I was asked what particular event sparked my interest in IT my answer would be my first few weeks of UNI. Before starting UNI I had a little bit of experience in HTML from high school where I had taken an Introduction to Computing class, besides that, I didn’t have any experience. However, since I started UNI I recently started to learn Python and as well as learn more HTML.

<b>Personal Information:</b><br>
      Anton Catalano <i>(s3890351)</i><hr class="small-line">
Born and raised in Melbourne, Australia.  I have an Italian background, where grandparents from both sides immigrated from Italy.  I completed primary and secondary school; went to Ivanhoe Grammar School. Completed VCE in 2018. I did study for an undergraduate degree in Speech Pathology at ACU for two years. I withdrew at the end of 2020 to pursue something that I am more interested and passionate about, which is IT. Speak fluent English and I’m a passionate follower of sport, especially AFL and EPL. My main interest in IT is the fact that I am engaging with technology daily. Whether it's from a television set to a laptop, I utilise it everyday. What's been a constant reminder of gaining interest in IT is of me solving errors that I come across when using a laptop.  Currently, I have great knowledge in knowing how to use a computer. Having utilised a computer for over 10 years now, I can understand the specific basics on how to use it. I'm also a keen learner and am willing to add some key skills to my arsenal. Whether it's from my casual job to currently in my first year, I'm really invested in learning new things and gaining such valuable insight.

<center><h1>Group Processes</h1></center>
<br><b>How well did your group work together in Assignment 2? Will you be introducing any changes in process for Assignment 3?</b></br>
<hr class="small-line">
<br> Our group worked really well throughout Assignment 2. Constant feedback and communication between all group members were evident throughout the course of 4-6 weeks and no conflict occurred within the group. Adding to this, everyone knew what they were doing with their allocated tasks, limiting any confusion between members and work that needs to be completed. With other commitments and family events occurring throughout the weeks, as a group we easily worked around these instances and managed to get the final result we were aiming to achieve, which was a completed report and fully functional HTML.
<br>
<br>
With the commencement of Assignment 3, as a group we have identified areas that needed to be improved from Assignment 2. This allowed all team members to understand the expectations and standards for this new task, enhancing the overall ‘motivation’ aspect within the group, which was predominately lacking in the previous assignment.
More time will be utilised for the process of this assignment, heavily focusing on completing each allocated task at time. This will hopefully cause the assignment to be fully finished in time with the set due date.

 <center><h1><b>Overview</b></h1></center>
 <br> <b>Topic:</b>
 <br>
<br>My project idea consists of a new, innovative way people in Australia can communicate sport related topics/discussions, with the use of other tools to help them gamble responsibly and have a higher chance of obtaining profit. I would like to create “SportsBuzz”, a website/app that is easily accessible to the public which will allow sport-minded individuals access to a service that will show live odds from competing sport betting platforms (e.g., SportsBet, Bet365, etc.) and compare the prices, giving users a quick insight on what every platform has to offer, and what the recommended bet they should place on any match. This project contains a live thread discussion, which enables all users to give their opinion on what the odds and expectations are for any game from any sport. SportBuzz is designed to fulfill a gap in the gambling market, which is to assist customers with their bets/punts. It’s aimed to enhance, unite and connect sport bettors all around Australia, by allowing free access to a service which promotes both party’s (Gambling Services & Customers), avoiding the concern of conflict.
<br>
<br> Our team will develop a prototype with a full outline of what the service will look like, how it will function and what features will be included for users. We aim to produce a service that is eye-catching and user friendly, allowing users to experience easy navigation and usability. With a combination and mix of various social media platforms that are well known today, we believe our product will make an impact in the sports-betting market for being “unique”,  and hardly any competitors are known for this service. This service will be available for only the Australian market and selected sports will be featured in the app/website, as it is primarily aiming for the most popular sports in Australia.

<br>
<br> <b>Motivation:</b>
<br>
<br>As sports betting has grown to become a national issue over the past decade, more and more Australians are continuing to lose their hard-earned cash over these addictive gambling platforms. Family and friends around Australia love to gamble, yet they lose quite a fair amount of money each time a bet is placed. This is why we are producing a service that not only gives users safe financial advice for betting, however it makes users much more financially smarter with their money, as gambling is known to be an addiction. This project we are producing is interesting to us as it directs individuals who are caught up in the ‘excitement’ of gambling a path to being financially safe. Most of us in the group are sport minded individuals who strongly believe this service can act as a tool for bettors on a national scale. One of the current IT trends nowadays is that society are using social media and their phones more regularly in their day to day lives, proving that an online tool to aid and resolve an online issue is the modern solution that is needed. This idea would show to a future employer the passion, integrity and creativity a group of young developers have for the world, by producing a tool with an idea that can help prevent a generational issue of gambling addictions, and save thousands of friends and families from financial difficulties on a national scale.

<br>
<br>
<br><b>Landscape:</b>
<br>
<br>What makes our service so unique is that there aren’t any services on the app store or online within Australia that provide users a tool to make an informed decision before placing a bet. The only “services” out there are mental health programs focusing on eliminating the act of gambling from a person's life, however some fall back in the trap of gambling and suffer the repercussions again and again.There are  Facebook pages and Reddit forums with the topic of “sports-betting” which allow users to communicate and share advice, however, only a small proportion of people in Australia use these tools and finding a reliable source is often daunting for the average person. This is why we are creating a centralised service that will unite all users, regardless of age (must be over 18), access to a user friendly gambling tool. As we do not fully support the act of ‘gambling’, we have noticed there aren’t many services out there that will help people place a bet smartly and safely, thus the introduction of “SportsBuzz '' can assist with this issue.

<h1><b><center><u> Detailed Desciption </u></h1></b></center>

<h1> <center> Aims <center></h1>

<br> <b> Aim: </b>
<br>
<br> To produce a service that allows users to gain sport knowledge, expert tips and gambling financial advice for Australians before placing a ‘sport-bet’.
<br>
<br> <b> Goals: </b>
<br>
<br>
<li> Produce an interactive prototype outlining the overall design and functionality of the service.
<li> Finish the project in a timely manner
<li> Produce a high quality report alongside with a completed prototype
<br>
<br> These are achievable goals that our group can achieve within the given timeframe of this assignment. The main objectives of producing a high quality report, completed prototype and an interactive service (prototype) all within the time given, makes this project a challenge, yet a plausible achievement. These goals must be achieved or nearly completed, with a few exceptions, in order for the prototype to be considered successful.
<br>
<br> The most important parts of the project is ensuring every team member does their allocated role efficiently and effectively and the group has a finalised interactive prototype outlining the overall process of our service. These areas or “parts” must be met as they’re the core elements of finalising the project and achieving our listed goals.
<br>
<br> The prototype and its design has the main priority over the other aspects of the project, as it is one of the main areas that requires exceptional time and hardwork in order to be completed. It also needs to be completed by every team member as it is a time consuming area and multiple people need to be working on the prototype at once.
<br>
<br> If we only have enough time or resources for one of the goals, it would be the goal of producing ‘a high quality report alongside a completed prototype’. This is an achievable goal as plenty of time has been given and the workload of the project has been equally allocated.


<center><h1> Plans and Progress </h1></center>
<br>
<br><b>1st Session-Monday 10th May:</b>
<br>
<br>This is a project designed to target the sports enthusiasts with a greater edge in getting the best insights into the competing sports betting platform. This application based concept would compare sports betting companies by prices and would assist in providing users insight into the company’s offerings and which of them, the user should place there bet on.
As highlighted, we are more inclined to developing an app and not a website. This is due to time constraints and us taking into account the general context that when people place a bet on a sporting event, they’re more inclined to use a mobile app rather than website, with its fast effect and convenience. We also made the decision to use Figma when designing the applications overall interface. All members of the group have utilised the web-based tool in the User-Centred Design Unit (COSC 2628), ranging from wireframing apps to designing a mobile apps interface.
For how large this assignment is, we as a group delegated roles to team members based on their experience and willingness to collaborate and get it done in a suitable time frame. Those that are working exclusively with designing the interface via Figma are going further to research how they can incorporate the important factor of sports betting apps of providing live odds consistently through our application. If they’re able to do so, we’re hoping to utilise this in our app design however if it is hard to come across this, then so be it. We are hoping to get an answer by our next meeting.
Each member has also been delegated to incorporate the Team Profile specification of the assessment and complete so by the next meeting. Most of this content has been completed in prior assessments, Assignment 1 and Assignment 2, so we are expecting members to get this phase of the assessment done as soon as possible.
Finally, all members have been assigned a minimum of two of the subheadings in the Detailed Descriptions section to complete. We all that that these will take time and require significant detail and input. We have set the deadline of it being completed and thoroughly proofread by the end of Week 11, 23rd May.
<br>
<br><b>2nd Session- Sunday 16th May:</b>
<br>
<br>In this session, three members of the group attended a meeting to digress and discuss the weekly progress. In this meeting we discussed about the early stages of development in Figma, as our Project Idea would revolve as being an application. They had researched into how the application would possibly be able to provide live, up-to-date odds consistently whenever using the app. We’d also had discussed about the complexities in being able to incorporate this type of software into the application. However they have a rough idea of what to do and how to do it and are eager at getting the task done.
In this meeting, we also were unsure specifically at how this app would like in general. Things like logos, page by page design and how features are to be incorporated were the queries posed in the meeting. We did come to an agreement that within our next class session,   we would get one of our members to from scratch design a sketch drawing of how the overall UI and design will look like. Bearing this in mind we would be able to effectively commence the overall design and incorporate this into Figma. We are still hopeful in getting our written content completed by the end of Week 11, 23rd May, allocating a full week to app design and structuring of assignment/website before the 30th of May deadline.
<br>
<br><b>3rd Session- Monday 17th May:</b>
<br>
<br>Our objective of this session was to attain a greater understanding of how our project’s design would look and to discuss, as an entire group, how we've progressed in terms of work in the past week. We attained a paper prototype representation of how the application would look like. Specific layout of how we could design features such as the homepage, what information to incorporate into each wireframe, alongside with how we’d provide the live thread discussion into multiple wireframes in making it more accessible for the user. This was really useful in gaging an overall perspective, because we already know what the project’s aims and overall goals are, yet, gaining that precise knowledge in how we would design it was especially useful. This really can assist us in really kick starting our overall Figma design of the app. We also started to develop the code in helping project the betting odds for the sports matches.
Furthermore, though we haven’t noted this in our prior sessions, we’ve continued designing our website for this assessment. We are wanting to really improve upon our HTML and CSS, in displaying our information and overall content effectively. Adding onto this, we are wanting to improve the overall design and layout of the website as well.
Each member has all respectively continued on working on their delegated writing associated parts of the project. There haven’t been any concerns addressed by members of the team, with in fact a few members asking if there are any other writing associated parts that need any further help or completion. We still are hopeful of getting our written content completed by the end of Week 11, 23rd May, giving us a full week to complete both the design of the app and the website. 
<br>
<br><b>4th Session- Tuesday 18th May:</b>
<br>
<br>In this particular session (with the other group of three), we discussed various aspects of the assessment by conversing on what needs to be done, what areas are difficult and what the expectations are for the remainder time length given. By going through each criteria of the given rubric, this allowed the group to gain a deep understanding of what we can achieve all together. With the challenges we faced in Assignment 2, this has boosted the overall motivation of the group and everyone is contributing efficiently. 
Another factor that was highlighted in this meeting is that Ben, Josh and Andy will develop the HTML/CSS of this assignment as most of their written work is completed. This will allow other group members to continue working effectively on their allocated tasks. 
<br>
<br><b>5th Session- Sunday 23rd May:</b>
<br>
<br>In this session, we had discussed our weekly progress and what we had done since our last meeting in the Monday Class. In this meeting, we discussed the continued development of the Figma aspect of our application. We have developed most of the wireframes, with transitions between them being implemented. Only what is left to be added is the information for each wireframe and just incorporating an overall design for the app. Furthermore, an objective of the next class is to show the Figma prototype to the remaining members of the group and gain honest feedback on improvements needed to enhance the project even further.
Research was undertaken into ways of incorporating software to display the odds that betting agencies share and provide recommendations to users of the best odds. However, all software’s of this calibre do require a payment and with its advanced nature plus allocated timeframe for the assignment, it was hard in this instance to incorporate. Therefore, we’ve decided to incorporate a random number generator program which when developed can consider what’s good odds, plus what’s not the best odds, giving that user experience of displaying the recommended odds at the best price.
Each member has all respectively continued on working on their delegated writing associated parts of the project. There haven’t been any concerns addressed by members of the team, and although having previously intended to get the written aspect done by 23rd, we hopeful of completing it by mid-week 12 26th May, giving us almost a week to complete both the design of the app and the website.
<br>
<br><b>6th Session - Monday 24th May:</b>
<br>
<br>For the last session of the semester, we discussed the remaining tasks each member had to do and clarified whether the team needed help with their tasks. The session also involved Daniel, our Figma designer, to share his latest work on our prototype to the whole team - which we were very satisfied with. Adding onto the developments of our prototype, we were able to determine which info is needed for each wireframe (eg: the particular sports we would be offering and their respective leagues as well).
Our code for the application is also progressing very well and is very much near completion and ready to be added to our prototype. We are progressing very smoothly as a team, and not much left is to be done. Josh was assigned to do a simple CSS styling to the HTML as a finishing touch up, with noticeable improvements compared to our assignment 2 layout of our website. The rest of the team is finishing off their remaining tasks for submission. 
As of 24th of May, Roles, Scopes and lImits, Testing, Plans and Progress, CSS, Group reflection, Feedback, and Report PDF still need to be completed by 30th of May. 
<br>
<br><b>7th Session  - Wednesday 26th May:</b>
<br>
<br>For this group meeting, we discussed our progress since our Monday session and each team member has successfully worked on their delegated tasks since then. Josh has finished the CSS for the content currently on the HTML (which more is to be added), and Josh & Andy has finished the Tools and Technologies, and Scopes and Limits section of the project plan. 
The future action after this date is to complete the Roles, Testing, Plans and progress, CSS, Group Reflection, Feedback and finalise the report and HTML for submission.


<center><h1> Roles </h1></center>
<br>
<br><b>Ben</b>
<br>
<br>Ben was the one to create the initial idea for the IT project and acted as the leader of the team, and designed the prototype by setting out what the product needed and also helping to direct who it is that will fill each role. Ben also completed the Aims part of the project plan as he was the one to design the product and thus would best to understand its aims. Ben worked with Anton to complete the Team profile. Ben, Andy, and Josh completed the tools and overview section of the as he knew how to best connect it to the product plan. Ben also worked on the skills and jobs section as he would know the best way to sell his ideas
<br>
<br><b>Liam</b>
<br>
<br>Liam worked as a designer on the prototype for the product working to design a colour scheme and design principle for the app as well as designing and coding the back systems for the app. Liam also completed the roles section of the project plan as he was able to observe and see the roles the other groups members fulfilled.
<br>
<br><b>Anton</b>
<br>
<br>Anton worked with Ben to complete the Team profile. Anton also worked on the skills and jobs section of the project. Anton worked on the plans and progress and the time frame part of the project plan as he was able to easily follow the progress of the team as well as the risks as he has a skill in risk assessment.
<br>
<br><b>Andy</b>
<br>
<br>Andy worked on the Tools and overview section and primarily on the website and the CSS of the site as he has experience in the subject and is skilled in the area. 
<br>
<br><b>Josh</b>
<br>
<br>Josh worked on the Tools and overview section and primarily on the website and the CSS of the site as he has experience in the subject and is skilled in the area. Josh also worked on the tools and technologies section of the Project plan as when working on the site he was best positioned to identify the needed technologies.
<br>
<br><b>Daniel</b>
<br>
<br>Daniel worked with Liam on the prototype for the product and did much of the groundwork for the Figma prototype and looked into the viability of using the APIs from the betting apps to get real live data from them. He determined that it was not worth the cost, especially not for a prototype. Daniel also did a lot more on the Project plan than was originally planned as he felt he was not pulling his weight.


<center><h1> Scopes and Limits </h1></center>
<br><b>Website/Application</b>
<br>
<br>
<li> A website/application that provides a free service that will allow users to choose their bets with more confidence by receiving advice based on professionally computed data from market trends and sports team/player performance. By positively impacting the declining figures of money loss during sports betting - and also freely helping users to gain profit off their bet, our project will hopefully become renowned throughout Australia as one of the top sports betting apps. 
<br>
<li>Users will be able to watch live broadcasts of their particular sport, provided they are hosted through national TV.
<br>
<li> The website will provide expert tips to advise users which team to place their bets on through their extensive research on the team (past losses, past wins, and performance as a whole) and their possibility of winning. Data will be weighed on both teams and a hypothesis will be made for users. 
<br>
<li>Through the development of the sports betting application, users will be provided the option of reviewing the team’s past match history including whether the team/players had lost or won, information regarding the MVP of each teams/players past matches. Furthermore, fluctuations in the betting odds of both teams throughout the course of the allowed time given to users to place their bets, allowing users to keep up to date with trends of betting odds.
<br>
	<li>The app will provide live updated fluctuations of betting odds, news of team updates (these can range from popular headlines such as a member leaving a certain team, injuries to small updates like receiving a new coach).
<br>
	<li>A sports betting application that provides users with a large variety of sports to bet and betting options.
<br>
<li>The sports betting application will provide diversity and variety for users in regards to the sports users may want to bet on some of which include, boxing, mma, esports, soccer, AFL, basketball and many more. 
<br>
<li>Furthermore, the betting options given to users will allow users to place bets on several factors, for example for boxing or MMA the option to bet on which round the fight will end, the outcome of match whether it is by KO (knockout) , TKO (technical knockout), or DQ (disqualification). 
<br>
	<li>For other sports such as basketball, options for betting include, whether a team will score over a specific amount of points, whether a player will score over a specific amount of points, or the option to bet on which team wins in the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th quarter of the match. Furthermore, the option to bet on whether a team will score over a specific amount of points will be given to other sports that involve a point system also such as hockey, soccer, and AFL.
<br>
	<li>Users will be able to subscribe/unsubscribe from these news feeds to suit their interests as they may only be interested in Cricket and not the NFL.
<br>
	<li>A clean, aesthetic and professional design of both the application and website SportsBuzz that will be on par or even better than many competitors such as SportsBet, Neds and Palmerbet. 
<br>
	<li>A website and application that involves the high-level use of the principles of heuristic design, such as proximity, colour, contrast, typeface, etc. To ensure our users are satisfied with not only the content and services available through SportsBuzz, but also an aesthetically pleasing navigation through their uses.
<br>
	<li>The design of the sports betting application will be a simple, yet aesthetic and organised design
<br>
	<li>Timetables of each sport will be available through their sublinks, to avoid clunkiness as they are all separated. 
<br>
	<li>The design of the application will allow users to view all upcoming matches relating to the specific sport they are looking to place their bets on.
<br>
<br><b>Users</b>
<br>
<br>
<li>A fully functional application that will be free to download for all Australians on Android and iOS platforms as well as being easily accessible through the SportsBuzz website.
<br>
	<li>The forum styled website will have many users, with each user having their own “level” progression to showcase some sort of achievement to their commitment towards the application however will not have any advantage over beginners to ensure all users receive equity and equality in betting. Users will be able to “upvote” or “downvote” comments, report, edit and share to improve sociability and interaction within the application/website.
<br>
	<li>Our team wishes to see a user friendly community that upholds our policies to ensure the best user experience. 
<br>
	<li>Our team will allocate friendly mods and admins to ensure users are following these policies. 
<br>
	<li>As our project will offer more than just simple betting by working in conjunction with a reddit-inspired forum, this increases the scope of our app from a traditional sports betting app to a unique service that offers differentiality. 
<br>
	<li>“Differentiality” in this case refers to the implementation of a forum and ‘social’ system within the application, as opposed to apps like SportsBet not having any interaction with other users on the application. 
<br>
	<li>Users will be able to post questions, queries, and media for other users to answer/reply on.
<br>
	<li>Team profiles will be available for users to freely view all their stats for all seasons (these include win/loss ratio, goals, career, and more extensive detail) , as well as specific stats of each member to accurately assess performance and aid in decisions of placements of bets. 
<br>
	<li>There will be main forums and subforums that users can directly subscribe to in order to view their particular interests.
<br>
	<li>Users will be able to freely friend, directly message, or even block other users for their own safety - representing a typical social system. 
<br>
	<li>There will be a “FAQ” and “Help Centre” section for users to post their queries relating to SportsBuzz that cannot be otherwise answered through forums. 
<br> 
	<li> The “FAQ” and “Help Centre” section of the sports betting application will allow users who encounter any issues regarding their bet placement or any other issues to have a revenue to resolve those issues
<br>
	<li> The “FAQ” will contain commonly asked questions relating to the users account as well deposits and withdrawals. Questions including, “How to reset your password”, “How do I verify my account”, “I forgot my username and password”, “Rules, Terms and conditions”, “How do I deposit”, “How long does a deposit take”, “How do i withdraw”, “How long do withdrawals take”


<center><h1> Tools and Technologies </h1></center>
<br>
<br>The technologies required for this project will heavily relate to software-development tools and services, these will range from:
<br>
<br><b>Software:</b>
<br>
<br>
<li>Hyper-Text Markup Language (HTML) - This will be hosted on a github repository project, using ATOM (V1.57 as of date) as the text editor and as a CSS style language. No software licenses should be required as of now. 

<li>For the application, Figma.com will be used to create an interactive prototype for the project -  this is created through their website figma.com

<li>The website will involve calculations in their decisions to advise users to place their bets on the highest winning odds - meaning a sort of math/solving function will be required. Python will most likely help in this situation and will require coding software such as PyCharm Community Edition (Version 2021.1.1) if not using the ‘Pro’ edition which will incur extra licensing costs or websites such as Trinket.io to create our python code.

<li>Google trends (this is used to research the market trends surrounding sports betting - this is huge as our sports betting project will include mostly every major sport in the globe ranging from Tennis, Horse racing, Cricket, Golf, Football, and many more.

<li>Design-inspiration websites such as W3Schools to refine the visual appearance of our website 

<li>Communication tools such as Microsoft Teams will be used to keep in contact and track the teams progress, as well as host group meetings
<br>
<br>
<br><b>Hardware:</b>
<br>
<br>
<li>Hardware needed will be an android and iOS system, to fully test our figma prototype for their respective operating systems.

<li>A PC will also be required to research, create and form our project from start to finish. The PC will hold most if not all our tools required for this project as it will contain all the software.
<br>
<br><b>Experience:</b>
<br>
<br>
<li>The team will have the foundation experience of HTML, Figma and Python as it is learned in our core classes for the Bachelor of IT - more specifically our Intro to IT, UCD and Intro to Programming classes. 

<li>Josh, Liam, Andy, Anton have CSS styling experience, which will greatly help in achieving a clean, coherent and professional website for our project.

<li>As iterated in previous team profiles, all of our group members have vast and perplexed understanding of computers and technologies from a young age, allowing our team to complete our project more efficiently and effectively due to previously gained experience. Team members have worked together in previous assessments meaning we have previous experience as a group, which is an additive in producing our project to a higher standard.


<h1> <center> Testing <center></h1>	
<br>
	<br><b>How will you test your project? How will you know when you have succeeded?</b>
	<br>
	<br>We will test the functionality of SportsBuzz by ensuring that the user interface is simple, clean and easy to interpret. By having a user friendly interface, we will take the next step discovering if all allocated buttons displayed go to the correct page or not. If there are issues with the navigation, this will easily be fixed during the development stage and coordinated by Liam and Daniel, our lead designers. This also corresponds to any other issues that may arise and will also be handled by Liam and Daniel. 
	<br>
		<br>When the prototype is fully developed and meets the basic requirements, we will send out the product to all group members and a handful of selected individuals (friends and family) to test out for themself. We will follow up with a simple google survey in which the participants will use to give back their personal feedback, thereby allowing us to make changes we didn’t pick up during the development stage. We want a user friendly service, and by reaching out to individuals to test out our product, will make the end result efficient and effective.
	<br>
		<br>As a group, we will all know when we have succeeded when the end result is fully functional, user friendly and available publicly for anyone to download. The end product must have all the features we’ve listed in the overview effectively working and navigation should be stress free. 

	
	
<center><h1> Timeframe  </h1></center>
<center><img src="timeframe1.PNG" width="800" height="1000"/></center>
<center><img src="timeframe2.PNG" width="800" height="1000"/></center>
	
<center><h1> Risks  </h1></center>
<br> There are risks that do come with developing an application that contains the similar capabilities and features of a sports betting app. The main concern would be the advanced software we would use with it. This coincides with the need of consistently providing up-to-date odds of several competing betting agencies in a mobile app, whilst recommending to the user the best price to snatch on a game is something of an advanced nature and out of our capabilities at this present time. These specific properties in incorporating such software betting agencies have on their applications, alongside with gambling support, is something we’d be capable of if  we;d have had lots of experience with this tool. 
<br>
	<br> Some other risks that are associated with this project include the legal issues which come with promoting gambling, with certain rules and regulations applications that promote gambling should follow authorised by the authorities. Finally the inclusion of help and support for services for betting addiction are a must and incorporation of such an assistant tool/software would require quite advanced software/development to incorporate into an application of this kind. 



<center><h1> Group Processes and Communications   </h1></center>
<br> Our main mode of communication between the group is via Microsoft Teams. We also have other modes of communication where members can reach out to one another if not on our main mode of communication (i.e: Facebook, Snapchat and Discord). We meet in person in our weekly tutorial classes on Mondays 4:30pm. With us having a large group, six members, we jointly came to an agreement to split into two groups of three to conduct meetings. Each group will conduct two meetings a week through the Microsoft Teams platform. 
<br>
<br> We are hopeful that all members will attend all meetings, however there does come the likely scenario of members not responding for a time frame. If this were to come about, we would try to continue and notify the absent team members of scheduled meetings and requesting some information on how they’ve gone with their allocated roles. If we continue to not receive any word or communication from a team member, we would let our tute teacher, Anthony, know of this either via email or in person and await to hear what our next point of call would be.
